# cinema
Basic logic written in pure PHP is presented in SiteController.php 
The task to be performed by the code described below.
The seats in this cinema are ordered by upfollowing numbers so rows are irrelevant. 
If there are several opportunities where the people can sit, please return the ability with the lowest seat numbers (the first common) to give back. 
If there are no possibilities that the group as a whole can sit together, you need to put aside people until “it fits”. 
For example; If there is no place for seven people, you start looking for a place for 6 people, and you will put the 7th person on his own, preferrably near the group.
